!SECTION Introduction

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Don't be impressed

	I am describing some very impressive work, in my opinion,  but I
	didn't do very much of it

	Just helped with modeling and statistical details (and some
	logistical advice, writing, etc.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Rabies is an under-rated disease

	Poorly reported, little international concern

	Believed to be responsible for $>50,000$ human deaths per year

	Fear, psychological trauma

		We tend to fear things that are explicitly violent, and things we
		can't control

		Symptoms and death are horrible

	Economic burden of treatment

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Burden of some zoonotic diseases

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Rabies can be controlled

	The public health burden of rabies is overwhelmingly due to _canine_
	rabies

	In most or all parts of the world, canine rabies can be eliminated
	by domestic dog vaccination

		Domestic dogs are the key reservoir of canine rabies

		Vaccination is highly effective, people are interested

	The problem is one of sustained commitment and co-ordination

----------------------------------------------------------------------

!SECTION Reservoirs

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Inter-population spread

	Simple models of disease spread between multiple populations
	elucidate several concepts

		A _reservoir_ is a group of populations which can maintain
		the disease together, and transmit disease to other populations

		A _maintenance population_ is a population which could sustain
		the disease by itself

	A reservoir may or may not have a maintenance population

		Some diseases persist by relying on multiple populations

	To eliminate disease, it is necessary, but not sufficient, to
	eliminate ``maintenance-ness''

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Serengeti study 

	Studied spread of rabies in carnivores in Serengeti national park,
	and two adjacent districts

	Combined genetic, tracing and spatiotemporal data to find: 

		Rabies is transmitted between species, but not as often as within
		species

		Transmission in domestic dogs is persistent

		Transmission in other carnivores is sporadic (even when these are
		taken as a group)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Rabies cases identified

CAPTION Lembo et al. 2008 J. App.\ Ecol.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Control implications

	We compare the data to the behaviour of simple models

	We believe that domestic dogs are a maintenance population

	We believe that wild carnivores are _not_ a maintenance population

	Conclusion: there is some level of reduction in domestic dogs
	alone that would eliminate disease transmission

		This level is higher than would be necessary in the absence of
		inter-species transmission

		This level may or may not be achievable

!SECTION Synchrony and periodicity

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Spatiotemporal patterns of rabies in Africa

	Collected all available time series data for rabies incidence in
	either dogs or humans going back about 70 years

	Data and scripts all available online

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Spatiotemporal patterns of rabies in Africa

CAPTION Hampson et al., PNAS, 2007

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Investigating pattern

	We thought that these time series looked periodic, and correlated

	How to evaluate the evidence?

	We used a variety of permutation tests

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Synchrony

	Is there more evidence for synchrony than you would expect if you
	scrambled the time series?

		Yes, but this does not seem like a fair test

	Instead, we ``offset'' the time series by random amounts (wrapping
	back around to the beginning as necessary)

	To avoid multiple comparisons, we based our conclusion on a ``grand
	statistic'' 
	
		ie., add up all the evidence for synchrony from all countries
		into one number, compare this to what's expected at random

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Geographic correlations

SCALEFIG 0.9 synchrony/Geography.pdf

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Geographic correlations

	We cannot apply regular regression techniques to these points,
	because they have a strong and complex correlation structure

		Ie., we have 36 distances determined in each case by only 9
		actual points

	We therefore test by randomizing a variable associated with the
	countries (related or equivalent to Mantel test)

	After appropriate correction, there was no significant relationship
	between pairwise distance and pairwise correlation between countries

	This does not mean there is no such relationship, only that we did
	not find strong evidence to support it

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Periodicity

	Testing conservatively for periodicity in time series is hard

	There are many possible periods

	It is not possible to test without scrambling the series

	We tested by scrambling the first-order differences between points

		Scrambling points destroys all auto-correlation

	Found strong overall evidence for fast cycling

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Explaining fast cycles

	We found evidence for cycles faster than those predicted by
	published rabies models

	Based on our experience in the field and in the meeting room, we
	thought this was due to changes in human behavior at various levels:

		Governments allocate resources to rabies

		Veterinary officers respond to rabies

		Dog owners tie or kill suspected dogs

	We suspect all these behaviors ebb and flow with rabies prevalence

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD A simple model

	We added a ``response'' variable to a simple model of rabies
	transmission with vaccination

	The ``response'' level tracks the incidence of rabies, but with a
	characteristic delay

	For realistic parameter values, we find that response can accelerate
	the period of rabies epidemics to observed levels

	We also find some direct evidence of changes in response, ie., by
	looking at vaccination efforts

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Model results

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Conclusions

	Rabies in Africa is synchronous and periodic

	Synchrony may be due to weak coupling by cross-border transmission,
	or by cross-border response

		We don't believe it's due to temporal changes in reporting

	Evidence for ebbs and flows in human response

	Calls for a consistent, co-ordinated effort at control

----------------------------------------------------------------------

!SECTION Transmission

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD NW Tanzania study

	A remarkable effort at contact tracing, ongoing for many years

		Surveillance is now done mostly by field officers trained by the
		project

	Published study analyzes $>3000$ potential transmission events and
	identifies $>1000$ rabid animals

	These data are all available; we are working to make them all
	accessible

	We are also working to make the even greater amount of data
	collected since then available and accessible

HEAD Distributions

	We used maximum likelihood estimation to fit time distributions to
	both the latent period and the infectious period

	We also fit distributions to the number of observed potential
	transmission events by a rabid animal (ie., the number of
	individuals bitten) ...

	and to the spatial distribution (ie., how far do rabid animals
	travel; how far are bite events by the animal from the bite event
	that infected the animal)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Time distributions

SCALEFIG 0.9 rabies_times.png

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Estimating $R_0$

	We estimated $R_0$ in three ways:

		Rate of spread compared to time distributions

		Number of bites expected without control measures, $\times$
		probability of infection

		Epidemic tree reconstruction (similar to reservoir paper)

	In the latter two cases we had a more than one estimate, depending
	on different assumptions about unobserved events

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Vaccination

	We sponsored vaccination campaigns in the study area

	The government also sponsored some

	We find a strong correlation between inferred level of protection
	and size of rabies outbreaks

		This correlation is explained fairly well by stochastic models

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Vaccination campaigns

HEAD Vaccination and outbreaks

SCALEFIG 0.9 outbreak.png

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Demography

	We studied dog demography in the region

	High birth and death rates make it hard to maintain high levels of
	vaccine coverage

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Conclusions

	Low $R_0$ means that elimination of canine rabies and thus the
	public health threat of rabies is possible in this area

		This implies that it should be possible in most or all areas of
		the world -- it would be nice to know which

	Fast dog demography means elimination is not as easy as might be
	expected; co-ordinated, consistent effort is required

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HEAD Open questions

	Why is $R_0$ for rabies so consistently low?

	Why is there little effect of dog density?

	What happens to transmission when dog density is reduced by rabies
	mortality?
